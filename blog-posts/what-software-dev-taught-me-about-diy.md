# Coding life: what a career in software development taught me about home maintenance

## Intro

Join me for a journey into how we learn, why we find certain things easier to learn than others, and how we can apply this knowledge to challenging areas of our live, as I share how software development knowledge and skills helped me get better at home maintenance.

## Proposal 

Home maintenance is not for everyone, especially me. Countless attempts at what I thought were small home maintenance projects have ended up with me calling an emergency plumber/electrician/insert home maintenance service here at the 11th hour to fix the botched job after I've uttered those fatal words "How hard can it be" and attempted it myself.

Then one day, I experienced something that got me thinking. What if I could apply the knowledge I'd learned as a software developer for the last 20 years to home maintenance? Obviously I can't fix a leaky tap with code, but there are other skills one learns through developing software projects that might apply.

From that day on, whenever I needed to tackle a home maintenance project, I thought about how I would tackle a similar problem as a software developer, and I was surprised to find similarities. This allowed me to become more successful, and therefore gain more experience and confidence. 

This talk will be a story of one man's attempt to apply software development skills to home maintenance, with varying degrees of success, failure, and maybe even a few funny anecdotes. By the end though, attendees will gain a better understanding of why we find some things easier to learn than others, and how we can leverage this knowledge in multiple areas of our life. 

# What software development taught me about home maintenance

I've never been great with my hands. Countless attempts at what I thought were small home DIY projects have ended up with me calling an emergency plumber/electrician/insert home maintenance service here at the 11th hour to fix the botched job after I've uttered those fatal words "How hard can it be" and attempted it myself.

I think the highlight of my failure was when my attempt to replace a washer on a garden tap (or faucet for my American friends) ended with water gushing out of the top of the pipe, and me frantically running around trying to find the mains water shut off valve.

Pro-tip, find the mains water shut off valve before you attempt any plumbing projects.

What I did not realize was many of the principles of software development, a thing that I have been doing for more than 20 years now, applies to home maintenance. But it took a few aha moments for me to understand this.

## Let's start with drilling - it's all about the tools

I used to hate drilling any kind of hole. From wall plugs for photography in the house, to curtain rails, I constantly found myself struggling to drill a hole deep enough for the needs of the project. 

And then, one day, my drill stopped working, in the middle of a big DIY project. And so I was forced to buy a new one. And suddenly, a project that I was struggling with, was over in a flash. 

And stopped and thought about this and realized that maybe I was not the problem, maybe the drill was. It was old, my grandfathers, handed to me when he passed away, and maybe it just didn't have the power to drill effectively anymore.

And I thought about all the time I've spent over the years on choosing my IDE, local development environment, hell even my personal choice of OS, and how I try and choose the best tools for the job, that ultimately make me a more effective developer. But I had never considered being so choosy with my physical tools. 

And I had this aha moment, as I realized where a lot of my DIY failures came from.

Now, when my wife needs something hung, I rush to grab my drill, and the new spirit level, and the shiny new drill bits with the special tips.

## RTFM

## Continuous Learning

## Test

## The garage project - collaboration

Fast-forward a few years, and I now understand the value of good tools, I'm having some successes at smaller home DIY tasks, and generally feeling a bit more confident about myself. We move into a new home, during the middle of a pandemic. Not something I would recommend.

Our new house does not have electric garage doors, and so I have to arrange to have said doors fitted. The installer points out they will need a power socket on either side. With my renewed confidence, I consider the possibility of a DIY electrical job. Again, how hard can it be?

I've never worked on electrical things, but as I stand in the garage looking at my options, a thought occurs. If I was struggling with a software problem, and I couldn't figure it out, what would I do? I'd reach out to another developer who perhaps has more experience in this area, and ask their opinion.

So that's what I did, I reached out to a friend (and ex-mattician) Hugh Lashbrooke. If you know Hugh, you also know he's pretty good with tools and home DIY projects. So I email him, all the way in New Zealand, sending him pictures of the wiring, and he gives me some great suggestions.

With the knowledge of tools I buy a proper wire cutter and stripper, and admittedly I managed to trip the power to the house a few times, and it took me a full day just to run the wiring and install two new power sockets in the garage roof, but it worked, and 3 years later, it's still working. 

I'd be lying if I didn't show off my handiwork to every other experienced DIYer who visited us for the rest of that year. 

## The power was inside you all along

I struggled to find a way to wrap up this flash talk, and as I sat and rewrote this final section for the 3rd time, I realized that this was because I'm still discovering similarities between software development and home maintenance , and as we all know, we never stop learning. 

What I did realise is that, for me at least, software development was something that I possibly had some natural talent for, and so I never really struggled with it. And by realising the similarites between software dev and home mainteinance, I could apply some of the same priciples I'd leared from the thing I found easyt, to the thing I Find hard. 

And the point I'm trying to make to you all today is that if you have an area that you find yourself struggling with, and you think you're the problem, maybe that's not the case. Maybe you can take lessons you've learned from another area of your life that has similarties where you don't struggle, and apply them to this new area, and maybe you'll find some of the same princples apply, and it becomes less scary, giving you confidence to try, experience, and succeed.

If nothing else, maybe it it will make for a cool flash talk one day!
