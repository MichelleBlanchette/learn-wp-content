# Developing developers

## Intro

Teaching adults is hard. Teaching opinionated adults is even harder. And we all know how opinionated developers can be!
In this session, you will learn about the benefits of teaching other developers, some tips and tricks of the trade, and how it helps you level up your own career.

## Proposal

In 2022, I joined a fully remote team of educators and community wranglers as a Developer Educator to work on the educational platform for one of the largest open source projects on the web. 

In my previous experience an instructor and educator, my audience was always very focused. They were either paying to learn a specific set of skills or knowledge, or they were already a captive audience, being customers of the product or service I was teaching them to use effectively. 

Open source is different, everyone has their own requirements, knowledge level, skillset, and, more importantly, opinions. Not only that, but anyone, of any level, could be taking part of an online learning experience you are facilitating. 

In this session we will look at ways to balance these factors, to help ensure that your audience is captive, attentive, and more importantly, on your side. We will also look at how teaching technical concepts digitally can be both very hard and very easy, depending on the audience. You'll learn various presentation methods you could consider to mitigate the pros and cons of online learning. Finally, we will look at the various benefits you could gain from a career in open source online learning.
