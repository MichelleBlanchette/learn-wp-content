## Introduction

Hey there, and welcome to Learn WordPress! 

In this tutorial, we'll be going over the WordPress user roles and capabilities system. We'll be covering what user roles are, how to create them, and how to assign them to users. We'll also be covering how to create custom user roles and capabilities.

The WordPress user roles and capabilities system is a powerful tool for managing access to your site. It allows you to create user roles with specific capabilities, and then assign those roles to users. This allows you to create a hierarchy of users, with some users having more access than others.  For example, you might have a user role for editors, who can create and edit posts, but not delete them. You might have another user role for administrators, who can create, edit, and delete posts, as well as manage users and plugins. You can also create custom user roles with custom capabilities. 

## User Roles

WordPress comes with several default user roles:
1. Administrator
2. Editor
3. Author
4. Contributor
5. Subscriber
6. Super Admin (Multisite only)
