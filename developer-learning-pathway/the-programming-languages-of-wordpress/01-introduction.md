# Introduction

Welcome to the programming languages of WordPress.

Now that you understand how WordPress works, it's time to take a look at the programming languages that power it.

These languages are:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL

In the following lessons, you'll be introduced to each of these languages, learn how they are used in a WordPress installation, and discover where to find more information about how each of them works.

If you would like to try out the code examples in these lessons, you're going to need a local development environment. If you don't already have one, check out the lesson on Local Hosts.

You will also need a code editor. If you don't already have one, you can try out [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
