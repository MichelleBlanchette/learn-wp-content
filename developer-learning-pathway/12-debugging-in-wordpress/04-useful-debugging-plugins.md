While the built-in debugging options in WordPress should cover most of your needs, there are a number of plugins that can help you with debugging your code.

You can find these plugins in the WordPress Plugin Directory by searching for "[debug](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/debug/)" or "[debugging](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/debugging/)".

[It would be helpful if the video can show the two different search results here]

Two of the most popular option are [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) and [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/).

## Debug Bar (0:24)

Debug Bar is a plugin built and maintained by the WordPress developer community. It adds a debug menu to the admin bar that shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.

When the `WP_DEBUG` constant is enabled it also tracks PHP Warnings and Notices to make them easier to find, and when `SAVEQUERIES` is enabled the MySQL queries are tracked and displayed.

## Query Monitor (0:50)

Another option is Query Monitor, which also adds a debug menu to the admin bar, and displays information about the current page request.

Query Monitor enables debugging of many things, including database queries, PHP errors, hooks and actions, block editor blocks, enqueued scripts and stylesheets, HTTP API calls, and more.

## Summary (1:13)

Both plugins are great options for debugging your WordPress code, and can help you track down issues more easily.
