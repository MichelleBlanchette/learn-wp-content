In this quick talk I'll be showing you how the two AI audio tools I chose work.

The two tools I chose are:
- llElevenLabs VoiceLab
- WellsaidLabs Studio

## llElevenLabs VoiceLab
Pros
 - Very easy to set up
 - Very easy to use
 - Fine tuning voice settings was a nice plus
 - Multilinugal option on the paid plan

Cons
 - Can only create one track

## WellsaidLabs Studio
 - I did however appreciate the things I had to agree to in terms of not creating content that is harmful to others, etc.
 - Very easy to use
 - Much better voice imo
 - I like the options to render by sentence, or paragraph
 - I like the option to change the voice style

 Cons
 - Annoying sign up process
 - Can't download anything on the free trial
 - No option to fine tune voice settings that I could find
