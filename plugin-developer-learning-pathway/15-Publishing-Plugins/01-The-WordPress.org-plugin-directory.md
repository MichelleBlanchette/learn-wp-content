# The WordPress.org plugin directory

## Introduction

When the first version of your plugin is ready, there's a good chance you're going to start looking at ways to make it available to WordPress users, especially if it's something you think all WordPress sites can use.

One of official ways to do this is to submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugins directory.

Let's dive into what the WordPress.org plugin directory is, why you might consider publishing your theme there, and learn about the process of submitting your theme to the theme directory.

## What is the WordPress.org plugin directory?

The WordPress.org [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) is a repository of free, GPL licensed plugins that have been reviewed and approved by the WordPress plugin review team.

One of the benefits of publishing your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory is that it gives you access to a large audience of WordPress users.

Folks can either download the plugin from the online plugin directory, or install it directly from the Plugins page in their WordPress dashboard.

## Why publish your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory?

Besides the fact that WordPress users can search for and install your plugin right from their WordPress dashboard, there are additional features you have access to when you publish your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory, including:

**Plugin updates**:

You are able to push updates to your plugin, and users who have your plugin installed will be notified in their WordPress dashboard when an update is available.

**Support forums**:

The plugin directory has built in support forums, where you can provide support to users who have questions or issues with your plugin.

**Plugin preview**:

The plugin directory supports a live preview of your plugin, so users can see what it looks like before installing it.

**Plugin statistics**:

You are able to see how many users are actively using your plugin, as well as how many people have downloaded your plugin.

**Plugin ratings and reviews**:

Users can rate and review your plugin, which you can use to help add features and improvements, and grow your user base.

## How to submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory

There are a series of steps you need to follow to submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory. Here's a high level overview of the process:

Step 1: Test your plugin - test your plugin in as many different environments as possible, to ensure it works as expected. Use tools like the Plugin Check plugin to test your plugin for errors, and fix them before submitting.

Step 2: Pick a good name - choose a name that is unique, descriptive, doesn't conflict with existing plugins in the directory, and doesn't violate any trademarks or uses someone elseâ€™s product names without permissions.

Step 3: Write good documentation - use the plugin readme.txt to give users a concise description of what your plugin does, details or links to any necessary installation, special configuration or service registration instructions and directions on how to get support, and what you do and do not support.

Step 4: Adhere to the guidelines - make sure you've read the [Plugin Review Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) and the [Plugin Developer FAQ](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-developer-faq/) and your plugin adheres to the guidelines.

Step 5: Submit your plugin - submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory, and wait for the plugin review team to review your plugin. This process can take a few weeks, depending on the volume of plugins being submitted.
