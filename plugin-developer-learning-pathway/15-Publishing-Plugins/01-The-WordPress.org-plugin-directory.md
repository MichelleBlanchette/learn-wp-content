# The WordPress.org plugin directory

## Introduction

When the first version of your plugin is ready, there's a good chance you'll start looking for ways to make it available to WordPress users, especially if it's something you think all WordPress sites could use.

One of the official ways to do this is by submitting your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory.

Let's dive into what the WordPress.org plugin directory is, why you might consider publishing your plugin there, and learn about the process of submitting it to the plugin directory.

## What is the WordPress.org plugin directory?

The WordPress.org [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) is a repository of free, GPL-licensed plugins that have been reviewed and approved by the WordPress plugin review team.

One of the key benefits of publishing your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory is that it provides access to a large audience of WordPress users.

Users can either download the plugin from the online directory or install it directly from the Plugins page in their WordPress dashboard.

## Why publish your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory?

In addition to the fact that WordPress users can search for and install your plugin directly from their WordPress dashboard, there are several additional features you gain access to when you publish your plugin in the WordPress.org plugin directory, including:

**Plugin updates**:

You can push updates to your plugin, and users who have it installed will be notified through their WordPress dashboard when an update becomes available.

**Support forums**:

The plugin directory includes built-in support forums, where you can assist users who have questions or issues with your plugin.

**Plugin preview**:

The plugin directory supports a live preview of your plugin's functionality, allowing users to see how it works on a WordPress site before installing it.

**Plugin statistics**:

You can view how many users are actively using your plugin, as well as how many people have downloaded it.

**Plugin ratings and reviews**:

Users can rate and review your plugin, and you can use this feedback to help add features, make improvements, and grow your user base.

## How to submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory

There are a series of steps you need to follow to submit your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:

Step 1: Test your plugin
Test your plugin in as many different environments as possible to ensure it works as expected. Use tools like the Plugin Check plugin to identify errors and fix them before submitting.

Use the plugin readme.txt file to provide users with a concise description of what your plugin does, along with details or links to any necessary installation, special configuration, or service registration instructions. Include directions on how to get support and clarify what you do and do not support.

Step 4: Adhere to the guidelines - make sure you've read the [Plugin Review Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) and the [Plugin Developer FAQ](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-developer-faq/) and your plugin adheres to the guidelines.
